 But what if we found ourselves stuck to one of those frustrating experiences, reflecting on its consequences, rehearsing its details, and cursing each choice we did, without having the ability to overstep it.

What will be the first idea that jumps to your mind?

Yes, bro! This is one of the “Over-thinking” symptoms, to think and analyze un conscientiously something way too much. How would you feel if you know that an over-thinking person is spending the whole night thinking how he could have done it otherwise in his day: « I shouldn’t have told Sara about what Sandy said! I must have apologized to Omar last month!! I didn’t do well in the office today!… Jay didn’t eat well at dinner, could he be sick? My parents feel shameful because of having a daughter like me! Do I deserve a wife like Natalie? Of course no!! …» it’s hard, isn’t it?...

ko0zt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ko0zt0/i_often_do_self_compassion_meditation_when_i_am/,I often do self compassion meditation when I am feeling down or anxious,1,2,1609459122.0,"It usually goes something like this:

""I am understanding, caring, and self compassionate. I am proud of where you are right now but know it may have been hard to get to this point and it may be hard to keep going. You got this. We are on the same team.""

This is usually a thought of talking to myself or some other entity of compassion. It usually evokes warm feelings and makes me feel better."

It was changed to diazepam to reduce it. Withdrawing from diazepam is so bad it makes me want to die.,3,2,1609459094.0,I hear withdrawing from heroin is easier. Has anyone switched to heroin and withdrawn from that instead? Is it easier? I'm literally about to kill myself. I have a cliff in mind which I can drive to - it's too much.

ko0tox,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ko0tox/destroying_my_nerves/,Destroying My Nerves,2,1,1609458472.0,"I’m 15. I live with my 35 year old sister across the street from my mom and step dad’s house. My whole life she has made me like what she likes and when I do like something else she makes fun of me for it. A prime example is when I said I like Back to the Future. Instead of saying something like “I’m not into those movies, but we all like different things” she literally acted disgusted. When I said I liked ripped jeans, she argued that it was because everyone was wearing them. When I said I wanted highlights, she said that it’s because everyone has them. It wasn’t and I honestly wanted both of those things and I do not follow the crowd so it was obviously my opinion. Lately she’s been making me nervous by saying things like “when your mom moves they’re gonna make you go with them.” I don’t mind living with my mom by my sister makes me feel guilty about living with her. Whenever I try to be talk to my mom she acts like I’m picking sides. I try to make everyone happy, but with her doing what she does, I can’t make myself happy. I’m starting to feel depressed because I lay in bed a lot and I have no energy or happiness to do anything. I am obviously depressed and I still try to offer to help her everyday and she thinks I’m so happy with her and she complains that I do nothing even though when i help I do something wrong and when I ask she says no. She’s the one driving me to depression. I honestly hope I can go with my mom but if I even wanna go do something with her I get told things like “I guess you pick her over me.” My sister also won’t stop talking about problems she having with Mom, like my mom let her husband borrow her truck because something happened unexpectedly and my sister needed her to take her to the dollar store, she keeps complaining to me that my mom lied. She doesn’t get I’m just a kid who doesn’t wanna know what’s going on in her, an adult woman’s life. What should I do and what should I tell her? I don’t want to make her more nerve wracking than she already is to me."
ko0rd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ko0rd5/warning_triggered_text/,Warning Triggered text,2,1,1609458235.0,"I have lots of strong feelings to end it, all of it
Reason:
I keep lying to people even when they give me second chances, especially my parents 
I lied to my parents about how i was doing in college and now they have to pay what i have in debt which is more than $70k
I was raised and treated to be the golden boy, to do good, to be responsible and make something out of my life no matter how small. The moment i left the nest i fucked up. I fucked up really bad. My parents just started building their dream house which they were working and saving money for. That’s 20 years of hard work. Now my debts stand in their way. I basically destroyed their dream. The only way to clear this debt is if I die. That seems like my only option. I’ve only brought shame and hardship to my family. Their health is getting worse because of the bad news and things i keep bringing and doing. I have no choice but to end it. It will free them from the infection that i am."
