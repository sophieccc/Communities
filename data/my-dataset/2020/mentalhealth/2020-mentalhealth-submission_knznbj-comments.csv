 But what if we found ourselves stuck to one of those frustrating experiences, reflecting on its consequences, rehearsing its details, and cursing each choice we did, without having the ability to overstep it.

What will be the first idea that jumps to your mind?

Yes, bro! This is one of the “Over-thinking” symptoms, to think and analyze un conscientiously something way too much. How would you feel if you know that an over-thinking person is spending the whole night thinking how he could have done it otherwise in his day: « I shouldn’t have told Sara about what Sandy said! I must have apologized to Omar last month!! I didn’t do well in the office today!… Jay didn’t eat well at dinner, could he be sick? My parents feel shameful because of having a daughter like me! Do I deserve a wife like Natalie? Of course no!! …» it’s hard, isn’t it?...

I live with my 35 year old sister across the street from my mom and step dad’s house. My whole life she has made me like what she likes and when I do like something else she makes fun of me for it. A prime example is when I said I like Back to the Future. Instead of saying something like “I’m not into those movies, but we all like different things” she literally acted disgusted. When I said I liked ripped jeans, she argued that it was because everyone was wearing them. When I said I wanted highlights, she said that it’s because everyone has them. It wasn’t and I honestly wanted both of those things and I do not follow the crowd so it was obviously my opinion. Lately she’s been making me nervous by saying things like “when your mom moves they’re gonna make you go with them.” I don’t mind living with my mom by my sister makes me feel guilty about living with her. Whenever I try to be talk to my mom she acts like I’m picking sides. I try to make everyone happy, but with her doing what she does, I can’t make myself happy. I’m starting to feel depressed because I lay in bed a lot and I have no energy or happiness to do anything. I am obviously depressed and I still try to offer to help her everyday and she thinks I’m so happy with her and she complains that I do nothing even though when i help I do something wrong and when I ask she says no. She’s the one driving me to depression. I honestly hope I can go with my mom but if I even wanna go do something with her I get told things like “I guess you pick her over me.” My sister also won’t stop talking about problems she having with Mom, like my mom let her husband borrow her truck because something happened unexpectedly and my sister needed her to take her to the dollar store, she keeps complaining to me that my mom lied. She doesn’t get I’m just a kid who doesn’t wanna know what’s going on in her, an adult woman’s life. What should I do and what should I tell her? I don’t want to make her more nerve wracking than she already is to me."

I was raised and treated to be the golden boy, to do good, to be responsible and make something out of my life no matter how small. The moment i left the nest i fucked up. I fucked up really bad. My parents just started building their dream house which they were working and saving money for. That’s 20 years of hard work. Now my debts stand in their way. I basically destroyed their dream.

Her mom died years ago and her dad died this year (not from covid). She has been living with her grandma and aunt ever since I knew her.

&#x200B;

She has been struggling with depression before I knew her and I only knew about it a year ago. I tried everything to support her but I could only do so much because we lived in different states. I even gave her the suicide hotline. At first glance it sounded like it worked because she said it went well and that they would call her the next day as well. The next day though they didn't call back, I told her that she didn't have to wait for them and I encouraged her to call again but I don't think she ever did.

&#x200B;

She tried running away once with her friends because of home life and school. I convinced her not to do it but I think about it a lot. She has also made comments likes. ""I have no purpose in life"" (this was when I gave her the hotline number) and more recently ""I just want to sleep and never wake up. I'm so tired!"" At this point I'm really worried because I feel like I can't do anything and nothing is working. She sometimes complains of body aches with most of them being headaches, stomach pains, and leg pains. It breaks my heart to see that she is stressed to the point of physical pain. 

&#x200B;

Now I don't have depression and I know I don't but I have been stressing knowing she isn't feeling better and I don't know what I'm going to do if she ends up killing herself (I won't follow her if she does but I will of course, be deeply distraught). 

&#x200B;

I already know that I can't do very much because I am an online friend and not physically there. I already know that most of the advice will most likely be ones I already know/tried. I already know that it's not my fight and she can get better by herself. But I don't want to just stand to the side and hope for the best either. I want to help."

Nor do I think diagnoses and labels are without their problems, but I am about to talk to my GP about switching medication and I need to know how to be able to recognize hypomania if I have experienced it.

For a while, I have been living with depression and medicated for it, which I would say worked reasonably well for a little while maybe? For sure, my meds are not working as they should be by now. A few things led me to question whether I have depression or if it is bipolar depression: 1.) When I last saw my doctor, who asked how my meds were, I told him I thought my meds were only ""working half the time"" because I was experiencing dramatic ups and downs in a fairly predictable cycle. 2.) During a blow-up with my parents where I was overcome by rage, my parents accused me of needing to see a professional for manic depression rather than depression alone. 3.)  A new therapist that I have seen claims she thinks I show more symptoms of bipolar than depression. She bases this on what I have told her about restless 'episodes' where I feel very creative but also highly irritable.Why do I doubt that it could be bipolar disorder? Mainly cause I don't feel grandiosity or elation. I pretty much feel sad most/all of the time but occasionally I will have days where instead of sad I feel really irritable and creative (almost like an acid trip?). I also tend to embellish my experiences so I worry that my therapist could be interpreting my words which could be inflated or overstated, as I am an emotional person obviously.

I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this and I am terribly sorry to anyone who is bugged by this post, but I suppose I am asking the question *how can I know if I am experiencing a 'manic period'? How do I know if it is more than depression? Could these odd swings be caused by my current medication or extenuating circumstances? What is the next step in finding out which it is?*

Edit 1: A few extra details for those who might want it. \*On nights where I am able to sleep, I constantly have dreams of me causing an irrational scene in front of my family, where I blow up into a rage and scare them. I have done this before in real life and it terrifies me the idea that I could harm them or make them feel threatened. I don't really know what these dreams mean but I know that they manifest fear I have of this 'angry side.' \*My family has a strong medical history with persistent depression and a weaker medical history with bipolar disorder (at least one member on my dad's side had it?) \*My therapist also contends it could be bipolar disorder because of my obsession with certain things, my proclivity to self-sabotage, and the fact I have expressed that medication may not be for me because I sometimes like this 'angry side' of me for the creativity it brings out of me."

I'm a first year at a london uni btw. But yeah I feel like I'm not doing well in my friendships. Some advice?,3,4,1609455415.0,"Hi r/mentalhealth.

Before I launch off, this is a very very long post (took me like 1 and a half hours lol) and would probably take you 20 minutes to digest so I would say brace urself if ur really determined to help out. This post discusses my successes and failures in making friends this term. But most importantly my worries about whether I will be able to hold onto my current friends. The post also addresses my social awkwardness and why I think I'm this way. If ur going to give advice, please read the whole thing so you can understand my situation better. And if you click by this thread, please take to help me. I would really appreciate it. Just 20 mins of ur day. Ty

Let's begin.

I'm kinda paranoid about whether I've made solid friends or not during my first semester. It feels weird to call them friends since they feel nothing like my old ones who I have a very close connection to (I've never been the best at making friends so only really had two good friends during a levels). While I did feel a bit depressed during my A levels, I realize quality > quantity. I could ofc not care about making friends but if I don't have these interactions, I won't make a good doctor since my professional identity won't develop. Also being lonely might take a toll on my studies (I hate it so much why does it do that?).

At uni, I've been struggling between quality vs quantity. But tbh both quality and quantity in my friendships have been lacking because of online learning and I live at home. Might be because of COVID but I still want to explore deeper. So I only really made some connections with 2 coursemates and maybe a third one (I'll discuss more about him but I feel like it's a very loose connection). No flatemates since I live at home. But I will be moving into a student flat at some point.

Me and friend 1 were both really eager to be friends. He reached out to me on the Imperial college london freshers app. A couple of days later, we even had a zoom call. It was taking off very well. This was 2 weeks before uni started. We still talk to each other regularly over whatsapp and have some solid conversations. We have at least one common interest so there's a talking point. I really think I will have a good connection with friend 1 over time.

Friend 2 has so many shared interests. We are basically clones of one another. He's a few years above me so I'm slightly intimidated by that. And he also has his own friend circle so I kinda feel like an intruder but I feel like it should go well. We got lots to talk about but there's still a problem. I'll come back to that.

'Friend' 3 doesn't have that many similar interests to me apart from maybe one. We mostly talk about work in our conversations and occasionally about interests and other stuff. I kind of feel inferior to him because he's very outgoing, good in social situations and isn't socially awkward like me. I'm basically the opposite as I'm kind of awkward in social settings. I feel like such an awesome guy would never want to be friends with me after finding out what I'm truly like so I feel like this friendship is doomed. He's good in small talk, he's professional but I'm not.

My attitude towards friendships so far has been going for quality rather than quantity so I've not reached out to millions of people just those 3 really. Friend number 2, I made a brave attempt to add him and explain that we have like the same games so we should play together sometime. Friend no 3 wanted to DM me something (after chatting on the main groupchat) so I had an excuse to have him on my contacts. And because he was there, we could start chatting properly.

Now onto the problems. Like I said. I'm not experienced at making friends at all. I can talk but I'm a bit socially anxious. But I will always face social situations. I forced myself to go to online fresher meetings and public speaking society. I almost got over my anxiety in social situations (after finding out they went better than I thought) but I haven't had any physical interactions with coursemates since start of uni (once freshers was over). Lack of social interactions has made me fall back into being socially anxious again but I still force myself to speak up in online class and I try to speak for a long time whenever I give feedback to others.

Now let's go back to when I said I'm a bit rubbish at making friends. Ok so I add them, ask how they're doing, their interests.How do I know how often I should text them?How do I avoid coming across as desperate when making friends? Like sometimes I'll genuinely want to talk to them but I fear that if I keep initiating too many conversations, they'll think I'm desperate. But at the same time, I don't want to text them once in the blue moon since they'll think I don't care nowAlso should I always initiate conversations or wait for them to start one sometimes? Because with friends 2 and 3, it's always me. Friend 1 and me do it equally so there's no issues but I still do a bit more than friend 1.Friend 3 did it maybe 2 times but pretty much I always initiate the convo.I always initiate the convo with friend 2.Now am I being paranoid for thinking that they're not as interested if I always have to start the conversation?I have to admit, they are receptive in these conversations and the convos always take off so it's not like they dislike me right?

So the thing is, with my current best friend, I never have to worry about these things. I can text him whenever I want and as many times as I want. I don't even need to do small talk to initiate conversations. I can just ask him 'hey what do you think of mario bros?' and that won't weird him out.

But with my uni 'friends', I can't do these things. It will seem random if I ask questions like that. I can't text whenever I want. I can't text them as much as I want.If I text them all the time, I'll come across as needy or trying too hard which will put them off. But how on earth can I deepen a connection if I'm supposed to limit how much I talk to them?How does friendship even work anymore? I literally can't understand it.

Another problem is that I can't really do stuff together with my uni friends because we can't meet in person due to COVID so we can't go the cinema or have a coffee together or any of those activities which builds friendship.That being said, me and friend 2 have plans to play together online in our video game so that should do something.

Another thing about friend 2. He seems another one of those sociable dudes who have lots of friends. So I feel like he's going to look down at me if he ever discovers my social awkwardness. He can talk about stuff easily but I can't. He might be annoyed by me then.

Also I was planning to have a study together with friend 3 but I'm worried that we'll do all these things together then he will ditch me when face to face teaching resumes. Why? Because of the way I am. That will hurt a lot. Trying to get close to someone and then get ditched. That's why I'm reluctant to invest in friend 3 since ik the friendship will probably fall apart. That's why I'm also reluctant to contact him a lot. And friend 2 to some extent. I want to put in effort to see a friendship which won't end. Not for someone to meet me in real life and think I'm a dork.

I've also failed when I tried to make friends with 2 other people. A girl added me when I asked about a flat groupchat and I felt we talked pretty well. The next day I asked how she's been keeping and she doesn't reply even though she read the message.So I assume she's not interested and never contact her again. I feel like if I did, then she would think I'm desperate especially when she seems disinterested.

Another guy I thought I got on well with. We had some really good conversations so I thought why not add this person? Seems like a solid dude. I was really excited for what I thought would be a great potential friend but he was like the other guy. Reads my messages and never replies. I said hi how are u doing? When I added him. Didn't reply. Funny thing is that he doesn't ignore me on the anime group chat and we had solid convos there. So I sent him another DM, it was read and ignored again. And I'm pretty sure he knows it's me and not some random person. I'm so confused about him. I've been thinking of cutting contact there too but surely I must be mistaken?

Now a few things about me before I close off. When I say I'm socially awkward, I mean that I'm not very good at small talk and feel fake when I say 'how are you' when I couldn't care less. Only for my closest friends. But then I wouldn't need small talk in the first place. If I genuinely feel like asking it, I will. Only if I don't need to fake it and I mean it. This is why small talk sucks. You pretend to care about strangers.I'm good at deep talk. I'm good when we have extremely similar interests we are both passionate about.But here's the thing about me. I lack common knowledge and have no interest in mainstream things like politics or the inbetweeners or any Netflix shows that everyone talks about. Understandably this makes it hard to find talking points with the average person. So I'm rather limited to who I can connect with. I don't want to pretend to be interested in main stream things so why talk to people who are?I'm interested in a few video games, history, the dark web and medicine ofc.Also another thing about me which makes me suffer in conversations. I have an extremely thin skin. Like if someone calls me an idiot (even though I'm pretty smart actually), I will internalize that insult and get offended and mad. I will get mad not because of the insult really but because why would someone say something uncalledfor for no reason at all? Also how can someone call you an idiot if they have no proof of it? Do they know ur IQ? Have they done an IQ test on you? This is the types of things that I think about when insulted.Now the issue is I'm very scared of being insulted because I'm not good at witty comebacks. I feel like if i say ' please don't say that, it's hurtful' everyone will think I'm a softy. I'm not scared of the insult itself really. Just my social awkwardness gets pronounced when I get insulted because I have no idea how to react to it. I wish there was a manual on it lol.This links to my social awkwardness a lot. I try to find the nicest way to say things and make sure there's no way I can insult someone by what I say. Because I don't want to be insulted back because I can't handle it.So this means I take longer to think about what I want to say. Even if there's an easy way to say something, I'll have a million suggestions whizzing through my mind and this is why I usually jumble my words when I speak sometimes. All because I want to say stuff in the best way that won't hurt anyone.I've tried to combat this by speaking my mind on a few occasions. I've got myself in trouble due to this on internet forums with everyone thinking I'm childish.

If I could start a convo with 'hi can we talk about history?' I wouldn't be socially awkward at all. Because we can skip the small talk and get into the deep talk which I'm not bad in. But apparently society thinks u must be abnormal if u wish to skip small talk. Anyway that was a mini rant.

I feel like if COVID didn't happen, I would have maintained the social skills I developed and was working hard to improve. But ofc if you can't meet anyone anymore, it's going to suffer and plummet all the way down. But then again without COVID I might have still been screwed since I didn't make much friends in A levels.

Let me quickly discuss my old friends. In A levels, there was a bunch of new people coming to join our year group. But I already had a very good friend from lower years so he was one of my good friends too for A levels and even now. The other was a new person but I liked him for the way he was. Like me, he hates small talk. It was perfect since I met another person who doesn't mind if I start with deep talk. And he was a mutual friend too with my other.I did socialise with others too during A levels but they were never anything more than acquaintances. Kind of like what my uni friends are now. Acquintances not friends.

Well done if you got this far. I hope you read it thoroughly since I really need help but I'm waiting to see if I can get good advice here on reddit. I would seek therapy I guess but idk whether I need it or not. I think all I need is a simple change in mindset. Furthermore, idk where i can find therapists. Also they will probably charge money which I don't have. My parents would just laugh if i asked them about therapy. Therapy isn't really on my plate unless it's free.

Also one more question: Is there any point in reaching out to more people over groupchats? It seems everyone's so distant with COVID even with each other. Nobody in my class groupchat has even bothered to get to know one another. But when there were small group tasks, it felt pretty nice talking to actual people for once. This only happened twice tho. Not enough times for them to pick up on how lame I am.

I'm sure that situational factors aid this most, however after living with depression since childhood with a constant mask on, I feel I have finally moved passed this chronic phase in my life. I am still trying to articulate how I was able to do it, but I think overall the most profound thing was my dad dying 2 years ago. Strangely it was the most painful thing I have ever been through in my life, I miss him daily, but something in me shifted and I started to feel like if I can let my dad go, then I can lose anything in my life and survive and be okay, also that if I can overcome that then I can overcome any challenge or fear and I feel a deep sense of being free now.

It's very weird and a part of me feels it's too good to be true because I lived with feeling low and disconnected from others all my life. But I wanted to write this to share for anyone else who has been through the motions of depression, particularly from childhood, that there is light at the end of the deep, dark tunnel and that we need to make active decisions to chose things for ourselves that are helpful or pleasurable, because we can have good days and enjoy life again. <3 Sending love and hopefulness for 2021 in these unprecedented times!"

I have managed to find myself in a nice place in life thanks to various factors. My suicidal thoughts are gone. But now I feel I've lost my plan B, the always present exit, and my anxiety symptoms have worsened significantly. They are caused by some events which would have made me nervous in the past as well, just not as much. This permanent state of anxiety takes a toll on these factors which saved my life. I just cannot fail, if I do, I will relapse into depression.
