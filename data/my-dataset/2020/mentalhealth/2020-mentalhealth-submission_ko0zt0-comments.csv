Yes, bro! This is one of the “Over-thinking” symptoms, to think and analyze un conscientiously something way too much. How would you feel if you know that an over-thinking person is spending the whole night thinking how he could have done it otherwise in his day: « I shouldn’t have told Sara about what Sandy said! I must have apologized to Omar last month!! I didn’t do well in the office today!… Jay didn’t eat well at dinner, could he be sick? My parents feel shameful because of having a daughter like me! Do I deserve a wife like Natalie? Of course no!! …» it’s hard, isn’t it?...

""I am understanding, caring, and self compassionate. I am proud of where you are right now but know it may have been hard to get to this point and it may be hard to keep going. You got this. We are on the same team.""

This is usually a thought of talking to myself or some other entity of compassion. It usually evokes warm feelings and makes me feel better."
